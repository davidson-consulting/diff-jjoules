# Contributing

----------------------------

For contributing, we favor the creation of pull request (PR) on GitHub.

## Guidelines for all pull-requests

* The pull request does a single thing (_e.g._ a single bug fix or a single feature). Simpler is better.
* The pull request must pass all continuous integration checks.
* The pull request must have an explicit and clear explanation.
* Whenever the pull request resolves an issue, add "fix #issueNumber" or "close #issueNumber" to the description.
* The pull-request title starts with a prefix stating its kind: `fix:`, `test`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `style:`, `ci:`, etc.
* The pull request must contain at least on test case specify the modification. 
  For example, for a bug fix, the pull request must contain a test case that was failing before the fix but passing after.     
* **Your contribution is highly welcome**! If you have anything interesting, then we welcome your PR even if it is not perfect at the beginning.
